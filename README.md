# 📊 Ecommerce Analytics Dashboard – Case Study

### 🧠 Business Problem

An ecommerce business struggles to understand key customer behaviors and sales trends across regions. While data exists in silos (orders, customers, products), the company lacks a **unified analytics tool** to track performance, identify loyal customers, and anticipate churn.

---

### 🎯 Objective

To design and build a **data-driven analytics dashboard** that allows business stakeholders to:

- Monitor revenue and order performance in real time  
- Understand customer lifecycle and retention  
- Segment customers based on behavior (RFM)  
- Visualize geographic sales distribution  
- Predict which customers are likely to churn  

---

### 🛠 My Role

I led the full project lifecycle:
- **Data ingestion** from structured CSV datasets into a normalized **PostgreSQL** database
- Developed an **automated data seeding pipeline** with bulk inserts and conflict resolution
- **Containerized the database** using Docker for consistent local and remote environments
- Designed and deployed an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** with responsive filtering
- Implemented **cohort analysis**, **RFM segmentation**, and **KMeans clustering**
- Developed a **churn prediction model** using Logistic Regression
